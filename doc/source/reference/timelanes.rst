Timelanes
=========

Timelanes are objects that represent a sequence of actions or values that can change over time.
They have no physical meaning, and can represent very abstract concepts.
For example a digital timelane can represent the loading of a MOT, being True when the MOT is loaded and False when it is not.
When the MOT is being loaded, possibly several channels on a device are set to some values.

Shot compilation consumes timelanes to produce parameters to be applied on devices.

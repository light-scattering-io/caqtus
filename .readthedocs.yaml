    # We need to use hatch to resolve the dependencies, but it will create a new
    # virtual environment, which is not the one used to build the doc.
    # So we reinstall the dependencies found by hatch in the RTD environment.
    # Would be better to execute arbitrary commands to have hatch build to docs, but
    # in this mode, we can't use apt_packages to install graphviz.
